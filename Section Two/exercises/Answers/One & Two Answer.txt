1.) Mutable means the value can be changed without
the Python engine creating a new data object.  Immutable
means that the Python engine will create a new data object
if the value is changed.



2.) Variables are labels that "point" to the data object.
This is important because multiple variables can point
to the same data object, meaning changing one appears 
to alter both. However, the data object itself was altered.
